# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

This file applies to the app that is created in Chapter 6 of the book—so the numbered step branches, not `master` ([more info](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/blob/master/README.md#chapter-6)).

Releases are done with tags in the form `[step]_[version]`, so for instance step `5` of version `0.1.0` is `5_0.1.0`, located here: 

[/GraphQLGuide/guide/releases/tag/5_0.1.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/releases/tag/5_0.1.0)
